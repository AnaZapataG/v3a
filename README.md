# W251 - Deep Learning in the Cloud and at the Edge

This hands-on course introduces data scientists to technologies related to building and operating live, high throughput deep learning applications running on powerful servers in the cloud as well on smaller and lower power devices at the edge of the network. The material of the class is a set of practical approaches, code recipes, and lessons learned. It is based on the latest developments in the industry and industry use cases as opposed to pure theory.  
  
The Spring 2023 class revision no longer requires that students purchase a physical edge device. We will use AWS accounts / credits and smaller virtual machines
to emulate edge devices. Once the chip shortage subsides, we will hopefully return to physical edge devices.
